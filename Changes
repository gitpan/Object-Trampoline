- Replace croak on $class->can( $name ) with a branch
  that attempts to dispatch via $obj->$name( @_ ). This
  accomodates plugins, AUTOLOAD's, etc, that might
  spoof the "can" test.

- Pod noting a nasty case of non-sharing in cases where
  the object is installed into multiple modules via the
  symbol table.

- Modify Bounce's AUTOLOAD to eval the construction rather
  than croak if it fails. This handles AUTOLOAD-ed constructors
  (which $class->can( $name ) fails on).
