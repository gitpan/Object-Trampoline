- POD.

- Minor code cleanups.

- Added 03.t to test variables installed via assignment-
  to-glob:  *{ $ref } = \$trampoline. This is also a good
  example of how to export variables into multiple packages.

- Fixed typo in eval (dbkliv)

- Update pod.

- Code cleanup: redispatching anon sub blows up with wierd
  stack error in 5.8.4; not that much code to duplicate.

- use_class got too klutzy due to issues with bookkeeping
  multiple calling classes. Feh... Added Object::Trampoline::Use
  that does a use in the caller's package to get the object.

- Upated the POD.

- Add add'l argument for using the construcor class 
  ('use_class').

- Update pod to reflect add'l argument.

- Still need to add tests for this; but it at least
  didn't break anything...

- So far so good, up the thing to 1.00, add some 
  more POD::::.

Mon Nov 21 12:55:16 EST 2005

- Replace single $obj->can with if-block that first
  attempts to get a subref then uses $obj->$name in
  order to handle classes whose first non-constructor
  method is an AUTOLOAD.

- Pod, debugging use.

- POD, example of handle catalog module, notes.

Tue Nov  8 14:26:53 EST 2005

- Typos in POD, comments.

- Added comments to 02.t

- Modify Bounce's AUTOLOAD to eval the construction rather
  than croak if it fails. This handles AUTOLOAD-ed constructors
  (which $class->can( $name ) fails on). If you're really
  perverted you can now even use O::T to generate objects of
  type O::T...
