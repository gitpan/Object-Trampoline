- use_class got too klutzy due to issues with bookkeeping
  multiple calling classes. Feh... Added Object::Trampoline::Use
  that does a use in the caller's package to get the object.

- Upated the POD.

- Add add'l argument for using the construcor class 
  ('use_class').

- Update pod to reflect add'l argument.

- Still need to add tests for this; but it at least
  didn't break anything...

- So far so good, up the thing to 1.00, add some 
  more POD::::.

- Replace single $obj->can with if-block that first
  attempts to get a subref then uses $obj->$name in
  order to handle classes whose first non-constructor
  method is an AUTOLOAD.

- Pod, debugging use.

- Added comments to 02.t

- Modify Bounce's AUTOLOAD to eval the construction rather
  than croak if it fails. This handles AUTOLOAD-ed constructors
  (which $class->can( $name ) fails on). If you're really
  perverted you can now even use O::T to generate objects of
  type O::T...
